# Future Sales Prediction

The dataset  contains the data about the sales of the product. The dataset is about the advertising cost incurred by the business on various advertising platforms. ***Below is the description of all the columns in the dataset:***

**TV:** `Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on TV;`

**Radio:** `Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Radio;`

**Newspaper:** `Advertising cost spent in dollars for advertising on Newspaper;`

**Sales:** `Number of units sold;`

So, in the dataset, the sales of the product depend on the advertisement cost of the product. I hope you now have understood everything about this dataset. I will have to carryout the task of future sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
